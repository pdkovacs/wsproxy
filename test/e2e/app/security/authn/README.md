TODO:

In contrast to authorization (which typically is related to the domain logic in ways difficult to ignore), authentication is completely outside of the domain logic. As such it cannot be considered as part of the system called _application_ in Hexagonal Architecture. Being an _adapter_, it may need to be moved outside the `app` directory
